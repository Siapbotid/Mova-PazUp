# Enhance

Enhance images by removing noise, sharpening, and upscaling while preserving the details of your image, including the faces of important subjects.

Just pass in an image and our **Autopilot** will automatically determine the best settings for the highest quality.

Additional configuration can be optionally provided, specifically:

* `model`
* `output_height`
* `output_width`
* `output_format`
* `crop_to_fill`

Please see the reference for further details. Check out the [available models](https://developer.topazlabs.com/image-api/available-models) to see which model options you have.

# Denoise

Our noise reduction models effectively remove grain and high-ISO noise from your photos, ensuring smooth yet detailed results. This endpoint is particularly beneficial when working with low-light photography or older images scanned from film, as it preserves essential image structure while greatly reducing unwanted noise or artifacts.

Just pass in an image and our **Autopilot** will automatically determine the best settings for the highest quality.

Additional configuration can be optionally provided, specifically:

* `model`
* `output_format`

Please see the reference for further details. Check out the [available models](https://developer.topazlabs.com/image-api/available-models) to see which model options you have.

# Lighting

Our lighting models are used to adjust and balance your images to elevate it's quality despite the sub-optimal lighting conditions of the original photo.

Just pass in an image and our **Autopilot** will automatically determine the best settings for the highest quality.

Additional configuration can be optionally provided, specifically:

* `model`
* `output_format`

Please see the reference for further details. Check out the [available models](https://developer.topazlabs.com/image-api/available-models) to see which model options you have.

# Status

Check and manage the statuses of your image processing jobs. Whether you are handling a single job or managing a queue of bulk image processing tasks, the Status endpoints allow you to monitor the progress and completion of your tasks.

This is particularly useful for long-running jobs, where you can track progress and retrieve details such as percentage completion, estimated finish time, and current state (e.g., pending, processing, completed).

## Get All Statuses

> Retrieve the status of all image processing jobs.\
> \
> \*\*Pagination (Highly Recommended):\*\*\
> For better performance and to handle large numbers of statuses, pagination is highly recommended. Enable pagination by setting \`paginated=true\`. When pagination is enabled:\
> &#x20; \- Use the \`limit\` parameter to control the number of results per page (default: 50, maximum: 100)\
> &#x20; \- Use the \`cursor\` parameter to retrieve subsequent pages\
> &#x20; \- The response will include pagination metadata with \`next\_cursor\` and \`has\_next\_page\` fields\
> \
> \*\*Non-Paginated Response:\*\*\
> When \`paginated=false\` (default) or omitted, the endpoint returns all statuses as a simple array. This may be slow or fail for accounts with many statuses.<br>

# Cancel

If an image processing job is no longer needed or was started in error, you can cancel it before it completes. The job must be in a cancellable state (e.g., not already completed or failed) for the request to be successful.

## Cancel

> Cancel a pending image processing job. If the job has already completed, or if it is not in a cancellable state, this request will fail with a conflict error. Use this to prevent unnecessary costs for jobs started in error.<br>
