# Available Models

Topaz Labs offers two different general classes of AI models:

* **Standard:** These models are incredibly fast and efficient, and preserve the original fidelity and details of source images with maximum accuracy. *Recommended for most professional use cases.*
* **Generative:** These models can produce the highest quality and most creative outputs, at the cost of speed and fidelity to the original image. *Recommended for most creative use cases.*

> Generative models are only available as asynchronous endpoints since these powerful models can take up to several minutes to complete; blocking a HTTP request for extended periods of time is not recommended.

### Enhance

These are our industry-standard upscaling and image enhancement models, which run blazingly fast and work great for most scenarios.

Each of the models listed below are of the **Standard** class. None of these models are generative or diffusion-based.

| Model               | Description                                                                                             | Parameters                                                                                                                                       |

* `prompt`: A description of the resulting image you are looking for. **The model responds more to a descriptive statement versus a directive one**. For example, use the phrase "girl with red hair and blue eyes" instead of "change the girl's hair to red and make her eyes blue" (text - max 1024 characters).
* `autoprompt`: Whether you want to use our state-of-the-art autoprompting model to auto-generate a prompt for you. If enabled, ignores value given to `prompt`. (boolean).
* `creativity`: Lower creativity values maintain the highest fidelity to the original image. Higher values take more liberties and provide more creative results for specific details. (integer from 1 to 6).
* `texture`: Add texture to the image. Recommend setting texture to 1 for at a low creativity level, and 3 for more creative results at a higher creativity level. (integer from 1 to 5).

* `denoise`: Reduces noise in the image. (decimal from 0 to 1).
* `detail`: Adjusts the level of added detail after rendering. (decimal from 0 to 1).

These parameters should be appended as key-value fields in the form-data request bodies (i.e. alongside the `model`, `output_height`, and `face_enhancement` etc. fields). Any parameters not explicitly provided are <mark style="color:blue;">**automatically**</mark> configured by our auto-parameter model. Extra parameters provided that are not supported are ignored.

* `strength`: Increases details. Too much sharpening can create an unrealistic result. (decimal from 0 to 1).
* `detail`: Increases details. Too much sharpening can create an unrealistic result. (decimal from 0 to 1). 'Strength' was renamed to 'Detail' in Super Focus V2
* `focus_boost`: Use on very blurry images! Focus boost corrects images that are missing detail by downscaling your image then upscaling the results back to the original size. (decimal from 0.25 to 1).
* `seed`: Generation seed. (integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647).

These parameters should be appended as key-value fields in the form-data request bodies (i.e. alongside the `model`, `output_height`, and `face_enhancement` etc. fields). Any parameters not explicitly provided are <mark style="color:blue;">**automatically**</mark> configured by our auto-parameter model. Extra parameters provided that are not supported are ignored.

### Denoise

Remove sensor noise and grain from images, creating crisp and smooth details. Does wonders especially for low-light or RAW images. Under some scenarios, these models can even be used to remove dust and splotches on an image.

All of these models are **Standard** class models, and are not Generative.

| Model   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       | Parameters                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal  | Ideal to remove low-medium noise caused by low-light conditions or compression artifacts, usually for images from smartphones and cameras with their own denoise models to avoid over-processing. | <p></p><ul><li><code>strength</code></li><li><code>minor\_deblur</code></li><li><code>original\_detail</code></li></ul>   |
| Strong  | Designed to strongly emphasize retaining image detail for medium-high noise images. Use it for images from very low-light conditions                                                              | <p></p><ul><li><code>strength</code></li><li><code>minor\_deblur</code></li><li><code>original\_detail</code></li></ul>   |
| Extreme | Prioritizes removing as much noise as possible rather than preserving detail. Use it for images with severe noise or heavy compression, such as those shared over the internet.                   | <ul><li><code>strength</code></li></ul><ul><li><code>minor\_deblur</code></li><li><code>original\_detail</code></li></ul> |

* `strength`: Reduces noise in the image. Too high can remove detail and slightly blur the image. (decimal from 0.01 to 1).
* `minor_deblur`: Slightly sharpens the image. Counteracts softness caused by noise reduction. (decimal from 0.01 to 1).
* `original_detail`: Return texture and fine details lost during noise reduction. Start at low values and slowly increase. (decimal from 0 to 1).

These parameters should be appended as key-value fields in the form-data request bodies (i.e. alongside the `model`, `output_height`, and `face_enhancement` etc. fields). Any parameters not explicitly provided are <mark style="color:blue;">**automatically**</mark> configured by our auto-parameter model. Extra parameters provided that are not supported are ignored.
